CS305 Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report -- Software Security -- Java

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that provides individualized financial plans for its clients. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its public web interface using cutting edge security strategies. This Vulnerability Assessment Report provided the company with an evaluation of their current application as well as recommendations for modernization.


2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I thoroughly reviewed the client's software security vulnerabilities and provided in-depth reasoning for my evaluations. Coding securely is so important to a company's well-being because damage control is much messier than prevention. A successful security breach can result in disruption of business operations, exposure of sensitive business and personal data, loss in company reputation and client trust, regulatory fines, and bankruptcy. 


3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Identifying and suppressing false positives from the OWASP dependency check report was most challenging for me. I'm grateful for this experience because it has exposed me to secondary testing tools and I feel much more confident in utilizing these tools in the future.


4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I took several steps to increase layers of security for the Artemis Financial web application. For example, I used the highly-secure SHA-256 cipher algorithm to generate a checksum verification for encryption. In addition, I created a self-signed certificate for the web application and I refactored the code from HTTP to HTTPS protocol.


5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After I refactored the code, I ran a secondary OWASP dependency check to see if additional vulnerabilities were introduced. I also completed a manual review of the code to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities using the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram.


6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I believe the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram and the OWASP dependency check are valuable tools/resources that will be helpful for me in future assignments. I can use the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram to review my future work to ensure I have implemented secure coding practices. Then, I can use the OWASP dependency check tool to ensure I am using the best configurations and versions of third party dependencies.


7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I would like to show future employers my detailed Vulnerability Assessment report that shows my attention-to-detail and my knowledge of secure coding practices.
